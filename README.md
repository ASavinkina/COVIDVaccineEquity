COVID-19 vaccine equity code, to recreate paper:

“Estimating number of deaths averted and cost per life saved by scaling-up mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in low and lower-middle income countries in the COVID-19 Omicron variant era: a modeling study” 

Data is based off data from The Economist and Our World in Data (publicly available datasets included, with dates accessed).

In "Code" folder, "Vaccine equity prospective 12.13.21_LICLMIC.R" will provide structured data tables for analysis as well as descriptive data for Table 1.

"Vaccine_equity_Global_LICLMIC_1.20.22.Rmd" runs base analysis for two doses of vaccine, 
"Vaccine_equity_Global_thirddose_1.20.22_update.Rmd" runs analysis for three doses of vaccine,
"Vaccine_equity_Global_thirddose_1.20.22_everyoneomicron.Rmd" runs sensitivity analysis for what cost-effectiveness looks like if everyone has some natural immunity.

"Plots_for_manuscript.R" code provides code for all plots in paper.
